                        <p>My most recent job has been working as a Tier 1 Agent at Bright Planet Solar. I am in charge of ensuring that designs made for homes allow for the proper solar panel production that each customer signed for. I use software to create a mock-up of the home and its surroundings so that I can properly simulate the solar panel production. I work within a team to complete this task as well as review previously submitted mock-ups.</p>
                        <p>Another job that I have taken recently is being a Lawn/Pest Technician with Stewart's Service Group. In this job I would drive out and complete my scheduled jobs for the day. My main responsibility was to effectively and efficiently spray the customer's property with the proper chemicals. I would also face many customer questions and would have to use my previous experience in the job to give them the correct response. This was a very independent job and I had to make sure to motivate myself to complete my jobs for the day.</p>
                        <p>My longest held job was with MyCWHome. As an Independent Contractor, I was responsible for assisting the site manager to complete home improvement projects. These projects included painting, molding, kitchen/bathroom renovation, and house flips. I would collect the proper materials that were needed for each individual job and assist the site manager with designing and constructing at each home.</p>
                        <p>I have also recently been a Tecnhical Support Agent for SolutionReach. At this position I would be in charge of making sure that the company software ran smoothly on customer computers. If their software broke, I would answer the customer's call directly and get remote access to their computer to troubleshoot and fix the issue.</p>
